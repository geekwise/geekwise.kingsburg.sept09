### How to make a table
```
<table border='5px'>
<tr>
    <th>Turtle Type</th>
    <th>Price</th>
</tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Flaming</td>
        <td>12.99</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Extreme Flames</td>
        <td>200.00</td>
    </tr>
    
</table>

```


### Use names that have dashes `-` for example

```
my-file-name.html
```
* not spaces. only dashes `-` with a file name of `.html`

```
<a href='name-of-page-2.html>link to page 2</a>
```


### DOCType is how we command the browser to use HTML5

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### Proper HTML is about nesting and document structure.
